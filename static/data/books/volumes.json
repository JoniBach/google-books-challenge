I would read a hundred of these stories.\" —Shelby Van Pelt, New York Times bestselling author of Remarkably Bright Creatures Seven struggling customers are given the unique opportunity to take home a \"blanket cat\" . . . but only for three days, the time it’ll take to change their lives. A peculiar pet shop in Tokyo has been known to offer customers the unique opportunity to take home one of seven special cats, whose \"magic\" is never promised, but always received. But there are rules: these cats must be returned after three days. They must eat only the food supplied by the owner, and they must travel to their new homes with a distinctive blanket. In The Blanket Cats, we meet seven customers, each of whom is hoping a temporary feline companion will help them escape a certain reality, including a couple struggling with infertility, a middle-aged woman on the run from the police, and two families in very different circumstances simply seeking joy. But like all their kind, the \"blanket cats\" are mysterious creatures with unknowable agendas, who delight in confounding expectations. And perhaps what their hosts are looking for isn't really what they need. Three days may not be enough to change a life. But it might just change how you see it.",

I would read a hundred of these stories.\" —Shelby Van Pelt, New York Times bestselling author of Remarkably Bright Creatures Seven struggling customers are given the unique opportunity to take home a \"blanket cat\" . . . but only for three days, the time it’ll take to change their lives. A peculiar pet shop in Tokyo has been known to offer customers the unique opportunity to take home one of seven special cats, whose \"magic\" is never promised, but always received. But there are rules: these cats must be returned after three days. They must eat only the food supplied by the owner, and they must travel to their new homes with a distinctive blanket. In The Blanket Cats, we meet seven customers, each of whom is hoping a temporary feline companion will help them escape a certain reality, including a couple struggling with infertility, a middle-aged woman on the run from the police, and two families in very different circumstances simply seeking joy. But like all their kind, the \"blanket cats\" are mysterious creatures with unknowable agendas, who delight in confounding expectations. And perhaps what their hosts are looking for isn't really what they need. Three days may not be enough to change a life. But it might just change how you see it.",

Cats are mysterious creatures, and the relationship between humans and cats has never been simple. Curious and affectionate, independent and uninterested, predator and prey. Their true nature continues to elude us, and their subtle and complex behavioral problems can often seem unsolvable or incomprehensible. So, how can we tell if a cat is suffering? What are the root causes of feline aggression? And how can we treat patients who can’t speak for themselves? In this fascinating book—already a bestseller in its native France—veterinary doctor and psychiatrist Claude Béata draws on cutting-edge research and decades of experience to revolutionize our understanding of cats and transform our appreciation of feline mental wellbeing. Here, we meet Nougatine, a Siamese suffering from bipolar dysthymic disorder, Tabatha, an anxious Ragdoll with attachment issues, and Melly, an Abyssinian struggling with a feline form of schizophrenia—as well as their owners who seek advice and support. Charming, surprising, and offering illuminating insight into a range of disorders, Béata’s book calls for greater compassion and provides a new way of understanding cat behavior so we can care for the mental, and physical wellness of our beloved furry friends.",

The prevalent stereotype is that men prefer dogs while women favor cats. After all, dogs are man's best friend and women are crazy cat ladies. But these mainstream views are starting to crack. Have guys always loved cats? Maybe they didn't dare admit it in a world full of macho, out-spoken, dog-loving men. Or perhaps they're finally taking the time to notice the intricacies of cats. Women who favor cats aren't crazy; they're compassionate and wise. They know cats are delightful companions. Cats are loving, entertaining and helpful-who hasn't made a bed with the help of a cat? Finally, it seems, men are catching on-or, at least, are now coming forward to admit their love of cats. There are men as crazy about cats as us crazy cat ladies. In Cool Cats, Stories of Extraordinary Cat Dads you'll meet: The retired university professor who cares for a colony of feral cats. The homebuyer who was okay to learn his new house came with 16 barn cats. The guy who was crushed when his wife got two of their four cats in their divorce settlement. The man who had four figurines of cats on his wedding cake instead of a bride and groom-two represented his cats and two represented his bride's cats. The craft-beer loving cat guru whose license plate is CAT D4D. And many more devoted cat dads.",
